    "text_input = \"Machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks and decision trees, are revolutionizing the field of natural language processing.Sentiment analysis, a popular application of NLP, leverages machine learning to determine the sentiment expressed in textual data. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in NLP that uses machine learning models to identify and classify named entities in text, such as names of people, organizations, and locations.Deep learning models, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers, have achieved remarkable success in various NLP tasks, including language translation and text summarization.Word embeddings, generated by machine learning algorithms like Word2Vec and GloVe, represent words in a continuous vector space, enabling NLP models to capture semantic relationships between words.Machine learning techniques, such as clustering and topic modeling, are applied in text analysis to uncover patterns and extract meaningful insights from large collections of textual data. Natural Language Understanding (NLU) systems utilize machine learning algorithms to comprehend and interpret human language, enabling applications like virtual assistants and chatbots to engage in natural conversations. Machine translation systems, powered by advanced NLP techniques and machine learning models, facilitate the translation of text between multiple languages, bridging linguistic barriers. Information extraction, a core task in NLP, involves using machine learning algorithms to extract structured information from unstructured text, enabling tasks like extracting entities and relationships from documents. Machine learning pipelines for NLP typically involve preprocessing steps such as tokenization and stemming, followed by feature extraction and model training to accomplish specific language-related tasks.\""
