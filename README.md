## Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. It encompasses tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, language translation, and more.

This repository serves as a beginner-friendly resource for understanding and implementing basic NLP techniques using popular libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, and scikit-learn.

## Features

- Implementation of common NLP tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.
- Basic text preprocessing techniques including stopword removal and punctuation handling.
- Examples of text classification using machine learning algorithms.
- Sentiment analysis on textual data.
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) using state-of-the-art models.
