## Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. It encompasses text classification, sentiment analysis, language translation, and more.

This repository is a beginner-friendly resource for understanding and implementing basic NLP techniques using popular libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, and scikit-learn.

## Features

- Implementation of common NLP tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.
- Basic text preprocessing techniques including stopword removal and punctuation handling.
- Examples of text classification using machine learning algorithms.
- Sentiment analysis on textual data.
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) using state-of-the-art models.
